    <h2 id="about">About Carol</h2>
    <p>
      Since she was a child, Carol has enjoyed making things, particularly
      brightly-colored figurines out of the plastic clay
      <a href="https://www.sculpey.com/" target="_blank">Sculpey</a>. As an
      adult, she discovered the meditative qualities of cross-stitch and
      crocheting. She has also tried her hand at sewing her own Halloween
      costumes.
